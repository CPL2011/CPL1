SCALA: 
- class Graph, Node, Edge: functionality = (add Node, remove Node, add Edge, remove Edge, get Neighbours, 
(undirected edges are represented using two directed edges), get all Nodes, 
traversing the graph: Breadth-first, Depth-first)
- Node, Edge and Graph will use a 'visualization' trait to provide the Ubigraph functionality
- Simulation Engine: ...?

XML: 
- loading and storing...db4o? GraphML GEXP? get feedback
